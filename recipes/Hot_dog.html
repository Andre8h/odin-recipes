<h3>Description</h3>
<p>When the kids need a break from sandwiches, why not send them 
    with a hot hot dog to warm their bellies before going out to 
    play? This recipe explains how to keep the hot dogs warm.
</p>
<h3>Ingredients List</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 all-beef hot dog</li>
    <li>1 hot dog bun</li>
    <li>1 packet ketchup</li>
    <li>1 packet prepared yellow mustard</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare your child's lunch box by packing hot dog bun, ketchup, mustard, and Cheddar cheese.</li>
    <li>Preheat your child's insulated beverage container by filling it 
        with boiling water. Let stand for 15 to 20 minutes. I put the 
        kettle on when I get up and let it heat while the kids get 
        ready for school. Right before they leave, dump out water and 
        replace with more boiling water. The preheating keeps it hot 
        for a longer time. Place hot dog into the water and close the 
        lid.
    </li>
    <li>When your child is ready for lunch, they can take the hot hot dog 
        out of the container and place it on the bun. Top with ketchup, 
        mustard, and cheese to make a hot lunch from home.</li>
